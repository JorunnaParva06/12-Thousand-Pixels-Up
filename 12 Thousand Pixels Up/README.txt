Before you run the game, here are some things to know:

1. The file you should run for the game is called 12 Thousand Pixels Up.py
2. You need to have python and pygame installed for the game to function properly
3. This was developed using python version 3.10.11 and pygame version 2.5.2, but other versions should work fine

Otherwise, enjoy the game!
